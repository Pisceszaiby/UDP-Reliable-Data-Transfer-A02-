# UDP-Reliable-Data-Transfer-A02-
The client/server pair allows the client to transfer a single file to a server's local directory. The client/server communication runs over UDP on a very unreliable network.
BadNet files are given for testing the program. The underlying channel in the BadNet files has the tendency to transfer file with lost, corrupt, duplicated and out of order packets.
